 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

For my prototype, I wanted to make a game similar to the game Bloons. I used code from the rollaball project to figure out how to make projectiles pick up collectibles, then I set up the game in a similar way to mission demolition except there is no goal, and the level changes when you hit all 12 collectibles. Your score is calculated based on how many shots you have taken. The score will decrease the more shots you take per level. I wanted to make it basically the same gameplay mechanics as bloons, and it ended up working better than I expected. 

When I was making the project I thought of the MDA framework because I started with a mechanic that invokes a certain feeling in the player, In this case, frustration and the need to progress to the next level. I also added a high score to add to replayability.
